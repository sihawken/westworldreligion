# Christian Eschatology

Through the lens of Christian eschatology, Westworld frames the Delos Corporation’s pursuit of human immortality as a path to eternal damnation, a symbol of christian hell. This eternal damnation comes through the form of a digital resurrection, where the copied consciousness is trapped in a perpetual loop of psychological collapse and anguish. This perpetual loop is framed as “integrity” testing, where the human intelligence is repeatedly discovered to be a flawed copy (framed as a loss of “integrity”).
